## JavaScript Assignment Operators
Operator|	Example|	Same As|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|=	|x = y|	x = y|The Simple Assignment Operator assigns a value to a variable.|
|+=	|x += y|	x = x + y|The Addition Assignment Operator adds a value to a variable.|
|-=|	x -= y|	x = x - y|The Subtraction Assignment Operator subtracts a value from a variable.|
|*= |	x *= y|	x = x * y|The Multiplication Assignment Operator multiplies a variable.|
|/=|	x /= y	|x = x / y|The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.|
|%=	x| %= y	|x = x % y|The Remainder Assignment Operator assigns a remainder to a variable.|
|**=	|x **= y	|x = x ** y|The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand.|


## Shift Assignment Operators
Operator|	Example|	Same As|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|<<=|	x <<= y|	x = x << y|The Left Shift Assignment Operator left shifts a variable.|
|>>=	|x >>= y|	x = x >> y|The Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (signed).|
|>>>=|	x >>>= y|	x = x >>> y|The Unsigned Right Shift Assignment Operator right shifts a variable (unsigned).|


## Bitwise Assignment Operators
Operator|	Example|	Same As|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|&=|	x &= y|	x = x & y|The Bitwise AND Assignment Operator does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the the variable.|
|^=|	x ^= y	|x = x ^ y|The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.|
|\|=| x \|= y|	x = x \| y|The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.|


## Logical Assignment Operators
Operator	|Example	|Same As|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|&&=	|x &&= y	|x = x && (x = y)|The Logical AND assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.|
|\|\|=|	x \|\|= y|	x = x \|\| (x = y)|The Logical OR assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.|
|??=|	x ??= y	|x = x ?? (x = y)|The Nullish coalescing assignment operator is used between two values. If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.|
